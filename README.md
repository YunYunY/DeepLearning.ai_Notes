# DeepLearning.ai Notes

This repository contains my summary notes of [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). This is one of the best deep learning course series I took. I would definitely recommend to my friend who's also interested in this field. 

[deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) specialization has five courses available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The five courses are 

* Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
* Structuring Machine Learning Projects
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Sequence Models

I hope you enjoy this class as I did. Also please follow Coursera Honor Code - do not post any solution online!
